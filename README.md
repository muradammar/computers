Here is a pile of various designs implemented in HDL:

### 12_Hour_Clock.sv
This is a HH:MM:SS clock with AM/PM logic implemented using chained BCD counters and a 1-12 counter for the hour signal

### Full_adder.sv
This is a simple full_adder derived from scratch. See HDL.pdf for my handwritten derivation using truth tables and boolean expressions.
